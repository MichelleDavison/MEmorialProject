        <h1>The Washington Redskins Team Name</h1>
        	<p>Controversy surrounds the Washington Redskins' (and other teams with Native caricatures as mascots) team name as Native American groups ask that the team name be changed. <a href="http://eonm.org/">They charge that the name is a racial slur.</a> <a href=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/redskins/new-poll-says-large-majority-of-americans-believe-redskins-should-not-change-name/2014/09/02/496e3dd0-32e0-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html">Supporters of the name</a> contend that the name is a tradition that at best honors Native people, and at worst does them no harm.</p>
        	<p>Europeans since contact have taken Native identity and tried to mold it into forms understandable to them. Natives have been alternately exotic, brutal, peaceful, 'noble savages,' brave warriors, and duplicitous people.</p>
        	<p>The actual lives of Native people has been dismissed as Europeans <a href="http://invasionofamerica.ehistory.org/">forcibly took both their lives and their land.</a></p>
    
	<!--<h1>What is a MEmorial and how is it not a memorial?</h1>-->
	
    
   <!-- <p>A MEmorial is an elucidation of a memorial. Memorials unite communities around a mediated feeling about an event, whether that event a tragedy or a triumph. The problem the MEmorial addresses is that the memorial necessarily leaves out the voices of those who are made other by the memorial. The MEmorial will highlight those left out of, or actively marginalized by, a memorial. A memorial can be, but is not necessarily, a physical site that contains temples of marble and bronze. It can also be a symbol of a community and its values, such as the anti-Communist feeling in the U.S. during the 1950s and beyond, or the Puritan desire to eradicate witches from the midst of a community in the 1690s. In these two cases the ideals of capitalism and the church were the memorials, and the others were communists and those who served Satan. A MEmorial would highlight those who suffered as sacrifices to the ideals of the dominant community.</p> -->
	
   <!-- <p>My MEmorial will elucidate the memorial of the Washington Redskins football team and mascot. Most NFL teams choose mascots and team names that both convey strength and skill, and also have a regional connection. For example, the Denver Broncos, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys all have team mascots that reflect on the images of their cities. What is the city of Washington trying to say with a Redskins mascot? One could argue, as some historians do, that contact with Native Americans set English, and later British, colonists apart from their counterparts in the home country. Speech and foodways were changed, and there was a fear that colonists experienced as a result of the resistance to their overt land grabs. But the image of Indians the team chooses to use is one that has been historically constructed over the years of making actual Native culture disappear from the consciousness of the nation. My MEmorial will show how the creation of this image has diverged from the reality of Native American life from the time of contact to the present day. The choice of mascot by the Washington team celebrates the marginalization of Native culture to the point that it can only be represented in caricature and by the dominant culture. This MEmorial will show how this has harmed people over time, and still harms them today.</p>-->
